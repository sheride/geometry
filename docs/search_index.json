"],["manifolds.html", "Chapter 1 Manifolds 1.1 Construction 1.2 Smooth Maps 1.3 Tangent Spaces", " Chapter 1 Manifolds 1.1 Construction Let \\(M\\) be a second-countable1, Hausdorff2, locally Euclidean topological space of dimension \\(n\\). We define an equivalence relation on the set of homeomorphisms between open subsets of \\(M\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) given by \\(\\phi \\sim \\psi\\) when \\(\\psi \\circ \\phi^{-1}\\) is smooth. Let \\(\\{\\phi_\\alpha\\}\\) then be an equivalence class such that the domains \\(\\{U_\\alpha\\}\\) of the maps \\(\\phi_\\alpha\\) cover \\(M\\): the set \\(\\mathcal{U} = \\{(U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha)\\}\\) (where \\(\\phi_\\alpha : U_\\alpha \\to \\mathbb{R}^n\\)) is then a maximal atlas3. When endowed with \\(\\mathcal{U}\\), we say \\(M\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional smooth manifold4 (or manifol d). Let \\((\\phi, U) \\in \\mathcal{U}\\): \\(\\phi\\) is a coordinate chart (or chart) and the components of \\(\\phi\\), \\(x^i\\) (i.e., \\(\\phi_\\alpha(m) = (x^1(m), \\dots, x^n(m))\\)), are coordinates. We say real-valued maps are functions (e.g., the \\(x^i\\) are function s). 1.2 Smooth Maps Given another manifold \\(N\\), we say \\(f : V \\to N\\) is a smooth map (or smooth) for an open set \\(V \\subseteq M\\) when for all \\(m \\in U\\), there exist charts \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) defined around \\(m\\) and \\(f(m)\\) such that \\(\\psi \\circ f \\circ \\phi^{-1}\\) is smooth. Given \\(f : U \\to N\\) for arbitrary \\(U \\subset M\\), we say the same when \\(f\\) is the restriction of a smooth map on some open \\(W \\supseteq V\\). We call smooth maps with smooth inverse diffeomorphisms. We use \\(C^\\infty(M)\\), \\(\\text{Diff}(M,N)\\), and \\(\\text{Diff}(M)\\) to denote the spaces of smooth functions on \\(M\\), diffeomorphisms \\(M \\to N\\), and diffeomorphisms \\(M \\to M\\), respectively. From this point forward, all maps are smooth unless otherwise specified. 1.3 Tangent Spaces Let \\(T_m M\\) denote the vector space of linear derivations on the (vector) space of germs of functions defined around \\(m\\), \\(F_m\\). Equivalently, let \\(T_m M\\) be the quotient ring \\((F_m/F_m^2)^*\\), where \\(*\\) denotes the dual space5. \\(T_m M\\) has dimension \\(n\\), and we call it the tangent space to \\(M\\) at \\(m\\) and elements of \\(T_m M\\) vectors. There is a natural map \\(f \\mapsto f_*\\) from the set of smooth functions \\(M \\to N\\), denoted \\(C^\\infty(M,N)\\), to the set of endomorphisms \\(T_m M \\to T_{f(m)} N\\) given by \\(f_* X(g) \\mapsto X(g \\circ f)\\) (where \\(X \\in T_m M\\) and \\(g \\in C^\\infty(M)\\), the ring of smooth functions on \\(M\\)). We call \\(f_*\\) the pushfoward of \\(f\\). We define \\(T_m^* M\\) to be the cotangent space to \\(M\\) at \\(m\\), and we have the dual map \\(f \\mapsto f^*\\), the pullback, acting as \\(T_{f(m)}^* N \\to T_m^* M\\) by \\(f^* A(X) = A(f_* X)\\). There is additionally a natural map \\(d : C^\\infty(M) \\to T_m^* M\\) given by \\(f \\mapsto df(m) = v \\mapsto v(f)\\), which we call the differential. Given a chart \\(\\phi\\) around \\(M\\), a basis for \\(T_m M\\) is given by \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\) or \\(\\partial_{i}\\), given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\partial_{i}f = \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ \\phi^{-1})}{\\partial r^i}\\Big|_m \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r^i\\) is the \\(i\\)th Euclidean coordinate. A basis is also given for \\(T^*_m M\\) by the \\(dx^i\\). Finally, we define the tangent bundle \\(TM = \\cup_{m\\in M} T_m M\\) and the cotangent bundle \\(T^*M = \\cup_{m\\in M} T_m^* M\\); both are \\(2n\\)-dimensional smooth manifolds equipped with natural projection maps onto \\(M\\). Arguably, the truly important property here is paracompactness, which is slightly stronger and enables partitions of unity (enabling local-to-global promotions). However, it is a result that Hausdorff, second countable, locally compact space is paracompact (and we get local compactness follows from locally Euclidean). Second countability also contributes to the feasibility of Euclidean embeddings and other nice, preferable behavior. References: Second countability and manifolds↩︎ Hausdorff topological spaces feature points which are sufficiently disjoint: in particular, calculus depends upon limits, and Hausdorff \\(\\implies\\) unique limits as desired (note, though, that the converse isn’t true).↩︎ Definitions vary here (indeed, it is more conventional to merely require “maximal” atlases) but the general motivation is as follows: given a chart \\(\\phi\\) on a manifold \\(M\\), there are likely uncountably many collections of charts covering \\(M\\) containing \\(\\phi\\), but there is a unique (i.e., canonical) choice of equivalence class of charts containing \\(\\phi\\).

Calculus, in a word, is the mathematics of change: hence, we are interested in studying the least structured space that permits the calculus. This is not Euclidean space itself but rather a smooth manifold, a space that need only resemble Euclidean space locally.↩︎ TODO: prove equivalence of definitions.↩︎ "],["fibre-bundles.html", "Chapter 2 Fibre Bundles 2.1 Construction 2.2 Lie Groups 2.3 Principal Bundles 2.4 Associated Bundles 2.5 Sections 2.6 Integration on Manifolds", " Chapter 2 Fibre Bundles 2.1 Construction Let \\(M, F\\) be manifolds and \\(E\\) be a manifold endowed with a surjective projection \\(\\pi : E \\to M\\) such that \\(M\\) admits an open covering \\(\\{U_\\alpha\\}\\) for which each \\(U_\\alpha\\) has a diffeomorphism \\(\\phi_\\alpha : \\pi^{-1}(U_\\alpha) \\to U_\\alpha \\times F\\) acting by \\(p \\to (\\pi(p), \\xi_\\alpha(p))\\) for \\(p \\in P\\) for \\(\\xi_\\alpha : U_\\alpha \\to \\text{Diff}(F)\\). We then say \\((E, M, F, \\pi)\\) (or just \\(E\\), or \\(E \\to M\\)) is fibre bundle with base \\(M\\) and fibre \\(F\\). Analogously to manifolds, we require that \\(\\mathcal{U} = \\{(U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha)\\}\\) be maximal and refer to it as a local trivialization. \\(E\\) is locally a product of \\(M\\) and \\(F\\). Let \\(\\phi : \\pi^{-1}(U) \\to U \\times F\\) as described we say and, in particular, letting \\(m \\in M\\), \\(\\pi^{-1}(m)\\) is diffeomorphic to \\(F\\). Let \\((U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha), (U_\\beta, \\phi_\\beta), (U_\\delta, \\phi_\\delta) \\in \\mathcal{U}\\): On \\(U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta\\) we have functions \\(\\phi_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\phi_\\alpha \\circ \\phi_\\beta^{-1} : (U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta) \\times F \\to (U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta) \\times F\\) given by \\((m, x) \\mapsto (m, \\xi_{\\alpha\\beta}(m)(x))\\) for some \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta}(m) \\in \\text{Diff}(F)\\) called transition functions. Sometimes we require \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta}(m) \\in G\\), a (topological) group acting on \\(F\\) on the left by diffeomorphisms (i.e., a subgroup of \\(\\text{Diff}(F)\\)). If a fibre bundle’s local trivializations satisfy this maximally, we say \\(E\\) is a \\(G\\)-bundle, and that \\(G\\) is the structure group. We note that \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\alpha} = 1\\), \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\xi_{\\beta\\alpha}^{-1}\\), and the cocycle condition \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta} \\circ \\xi_{\\beta\\delta} \\circ \\xi_{\\delta\\alpha} = 1\\) holds on triple overlaps. Fibre bundles are uniquely determined by the base manifold and the transition functions. Given a manifold \\(N\\) and a map \\(g : N \\to M\\), the pullback bundle \\(g^*E\\) is the subset of \\(N \\times E\\) such that \\(g \\circ \\text{proj}_{1} = \\pi \\circ \\text{proj}_{2}\\) with projection \\(\\text{proj}_{1} : g^*E \\to N\\). A vector bundle is a fibre bundle whose fibres are vector spaces and whose local trivializations are fibre-wise linear isomorphisms. 2.2 Lie Groups Let \\(G\\) be a manifold with group structure such that \\(G\\) that its binary operation is smooth: we say \\(G\\) is a Lie group6. Elements \\(g \\in G\\) induce \\(R_g, L_g, A_g \\in \\text{Diff}(G)\\) by \\(R_g : h \\mapsto hg\\), \\(L_g : h \\mapsto gh\\), and \\(A_g = L_g \\circ R_{g^{-1}} : h \\mapsto ghg^{-1}\\). 2.3 Principal Bundles Let \\(P\\) be a a \\(G\\)-bundle over \\(M\\) with fibre \\(G\\) and transition functions given by left multiplication: we say \\(P\\) is a principle \\(G\\)-bundle with base \\(M\\). Equivalently, a principle \\(G\\)-bundle \\(P\\) is a fibre bundle with a regular smooth right action by a Lie group \\(G\\) that preserves fibres and the \\(\\xi_\\alpha\\) are \\(G\\)-equivariant7. Because left and right multiplication commute, we have an invariant right action of \\(G\\) on \\(P\\)8. 2.4 Associated Bundles Let \\(N\\) be a manifold with a left \\(G\\) action \\(\\rho : G \\to \\text{Diff}(N)\\); this induces an action of \\(G\\) on \\(P \\times N\\) by \\((p,n) \\mapsto (pg, g^{-1}n)\\) for \\(g \\in G\\). The quotient \\(E = (P \\times N) / G\\), which is characterized as a bundle by the base manifold \\(M\\), fibre \\(N\\), and transition functions given by the left action of the \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta}(m)\\) on \\(N\\), is denoted associated bundle to \\(P\\) by \\(\\rho\\) with fibre \\(N\\). For \\(p \\in P\\) such that \\(\\pi(p) = m\\), the local trivialization is explicitly \\([(p, n)] \\mapsto (m, \\xi_\\alpha(m)n)\\)9. In particular, the associated bundle \\(E\\) is also a \\(G\\)-bundle. Let \\(m = \\dim(M)\\); to \\(M\\) we can associated the frame bundle \\(F(M)\\), the disjoint union of frames of each tangent space \\(T_m M\\) considered as a bundle over \\(M\\): this is a principal \\(GL(m)\\)-bundle. The tangent bundle \\(TM\\) is the bundle associated to \\(F(M)\\) via the fundamental representation on \\(\\mathbb{R}^m\\), (or equivalently, the disjoint union of the tangent spaces \\(T_m M\\) as a vector bundle over \\(M\\)). Continuing, the cotangent bundle \\(T^*M\\) is the bundle associated to \\(F(M)\\) by the representation dual to the fundamental representation on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) (disjoint union of cotangent spaces), and the \\((k, \\ell)\\) tensor bundle is the bundle \\(T^k_\\ell M\\) associated to \\(F(M)\\) by the tensor product of \\(k\\) copies of the fundamental representation and \\(\\ell\\) copies of its dual (disjoint union of \\(k\\) tensor products of tangent space and \\(\\ell\\) tensor products of the cotangent space). In particular, the bundle \\(\\Lambda^k M\\) is a subbundle of \\(T^0_k M\\) given by only the totally antisymmetric tensors. 2.5 Sections Let \\(\\sigma : M \\to E\\) such that \\(\\pi \\circ \\sigma = 1\\), or a family of maps \\(\\sigma_\\alpha : U_\\alpha \\to F\\) such that \\(\\sigma_\\alpha(m) = \\xi_{\\alpha\\beta}(m)\\sigma_\\beta(m)\\)10; we say \\(\\sigma\\) is a section of \\(E\\)11. We denote the space of sections of a fibre bundle \\(E\\) by \\(\\Gamma(E)\\). In particular, we define the spaces of vector fields \\(\\Gamma(M) = \\Gamma(TM)\\), \\((r,s)\\) tensor fields \\(\\mathcal{T}^k_\\ell(M) = \\Gamma(T^k_\\ell(M))\\), and differential \\(k\\)-forms \\(\\Omega^k(M) = \\Gamma(\\Lambda^k(M))\\). 2.5.1 Vector Fields The basis \\(\\partial_i\\) for tangent spaces on \\(M\\) induced by a chart are naturally understood as vector fields on subsets of \\(M\\) and form a basis for vector fields on that subset. Given \\(\\psi \\in \\text{Diff}(M)\\), we can define \\(\\psi_* X\\) by \\((\\psi_* X)_m = \\psi_* X_{\\psi^{-1}(m)}\\) [^com:vector_field_pushforward]. Let \\(\\Phi = I \\times M \\to M\\) (\\(I \\ni 0\\) an interval in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)) satisfy \\(\\phi_t \\circ \\phi_s = \\phi_{t+s}\\) for \\(\\phi_t : M \\to M\\) given by \\(m \\mapsto \\Phi(t,m)\\): we say \\(\\Phi\\) is a one-parameter group of transformations or flow on \\(M\\)12; \\(\\Phi\\) induces a \\(Y \\in \\mathcal{T}_0^1(M)\\) by \\[\\begin{equation} Y(f)(m) = \\lim_{t \\to 0}\\frac{(f \\circ \\phi_t)(m) - f(m)}{t}. \\end{equation}\\] This correspondence has a partial inverse. A curve is a map \\(\\gamma : (a,b) \\subset \\mathbb{R} \\to M\\). We say the tangent vector to \\(\\gamma\\) at \\(\\gamma(t) \\in M\\) is \\(\\gamma_*(1)\\) for \\(1 \\in T_t \\mathbb{R}\\): this defines a smooth vector field \\(\\dot{\\gamma}\\) on \\(\\gamma((a,b))\\). We say \\(\\gamma\\) is an integral curve to \\(X\\) if \\(\\dot{\\gamma} = X_{|\\gamma((a,b))}\\). From the theory of ODEs, we are assured that \\(X\\) induces integral curves \\(\\gamma_m\\) at all \\(m\\) such that \\(\\phi_t : m \\mapsto \\gamma_m(t)\\) is smooth. Then \\(\\Phi = \\{\\phi_t : M \\to M\\}_{t\\in(-\\varepsilon,\\varepsilon)}\\) is a (local) flow (for some \\(\\varepsilon &gt; 0\\)) induced by \\(X\\). In particular, the vector field \\(\\psi_* X\\) and the flow \\(\\psi \\circ \\phi_t \\circ \\psi^{-1}\\) induce each other13. A Lie algebra is a set endowed with an associative anticommuting binary operator satisfying the Jacobi identity. The Lie bracket of vector fields, \\([X,Y] \\in \\mathcal{T}_0^1(M)\\), defined by \\([X,Y](f) = (X \\circ Y)(f) - (Y \\circ X)(f)\\), endows \\(\\mathcal{T}_0^1(M)\\) with a Lie algebraic structure. The Lie derivative’14 of a tensor field \\(T \\in \\mathcal{T}_\\ell^k\\) in the direction \\(X\\), \\(\\mathcal{L}_X T \\in \\mathcal{T}_\\ell^k\\), is given in terms of the one parameter group \\(\\phi_t\\) induced by \\(X\\) as \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathcal{L}_X T = \\lim_{t \\to 0} \\frac{T - (\\phi_t)_* T}{t} \\end{equation}\\] Alternatively, the Lie derivative is the unique operator \\(\\Gamma(M) \\times \\mathcal{T}_\\ell^k \\to \\mathcal{T}_\\ell^k\\) which obeys the Leibniz rule on tensor products and contractions, acts on functions (\\(k, \\ell = 0\\)) by merely applying the vector field argument, and commuting with the exterior derivative (to be defined shortly). In the special case that our argument is a vector field \\(Y\\), we have the simpler form \\(\\mathcal{L}_X Y = [X,Y]\\). 2.5.2 Tensor Fields Note that \\(\\Gamma(T_k^\\ell M)\\) is identifiable with the \\(C^\\infty(M)\\)-linear maps \\(\\Gamma(T_\\ell^k M) \\to C^\\infty(M)\\), as the \\((k,\\ell)\\) tensors in a section can act pointwise on the \\((\\ell,k)\\) tensors in another section, thereby smoothly assigning real numbers to points on \\(M\\), which constitutes an element of \\(C^\\infty(M)\\). This idea suggests an alternative—and preferable—definition. In particular, \\[\\begin{align*} \\mathcal{T}_\\ell^k(M) &amp;= \\left(\\bigotimes_{i=1}^k \\mathcal{T}_1^0(M)\\right) \\otimes \\left(\\bigotimes_{j=1}^\\ell \\mathcal{T}_1^0(M)\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\left(\\bigotimes_{i=1}^k \\Gamma(T_1^0 M)\\right) \\otimes \\left(\\bigotimes_{j=1}^\\ell \\Gamma(T_0^1 M)\\right) \\end{align*}\\] except we construct these tensor products not from via free \\(\\mathbb{R}\\)-vector spaces but from free \\(C^\\infty(M)\\)-modules. 2.5.3 Differential Forms Upon differential forms there is a natural differentiation operation, the exterior derivative \\(d : \\Omega^k(M) \\to \\Omega^{k+1}(M)\\). Locally, the exterior derivative acts as \\[\\begin{equation} d(f \\, dx^I) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x^i} \\, dx^i \\wedge dx^I \\end{equation}\\] for \\(dx^I\\) some \\(k\\)-fold wedge product of the canonical basis elements \\(dx^i\\) (i.e., \\(I\\) is a multiindex) and extends linearly. Equivalently, axiomatically the exterior derivative is the unique degree \\(1\\) antiderivation \\(d : \\Omega^k(M) \\to \\Omega^{k+1}(M)\\) which agrees with the differential on \\(\\Omega^0(M) = C^\\infty(M)\\) and squares to \\(0\\). We also have the following formula. \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} d\\beta(X_0, \\dots, X_k) &amp;= \\sum_{i=0}^k (-1)^i v_i(\\beta(X_0, \\dots, \\hat{X_i}, \\dots, X_k)) \\\\ &amp;\\qquad + \\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \\sum_{j = i+1}^k (-1)^{i+j} \\beta([X_i, X_j], v_0, \\dots, \\hat{X_i}, \\dots, \\hat{X_j}, \\dots, X_k) \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] Because \\(d^2 = 0\\), we have a cohomological situation: elements of the kernel of \\(d\\) are close d forms, elements in the image are exact forms, and the \\(k\\)th de Rham cohomology group \\(H^k_{\\text{dR}}(M)\\) is the quotient group of closed forms modulo exact forms. The wedge product endows these groups with ring structure, and the map \\(H^k_{\\text{dR}}(M) \\times H^k(M) \\to \\mathbb{R}\\) given by \\([\\omega], [c] \\mapsto \\int_c \\omega\\) establishes an isomorphism between de Rham and singular cohomology (de Rham’s theorem), which depends essentially on the identity \\(\\int_C d\\omega = \\int_{\\partial C} \\omega\\) (Stokes’ theorem). TODO: bundle-valued differential forms 2.6 Integration on Manifolds TODO Some authors require the inverse map \\(g \\mapsto g^{-1}\\) to be smooth as well, but this follows from the smoothness of the binary operation.↩︎ The second definition admits an exchange between fibre-preservation and \\(P/G = M\\)↩︎ If \\(p \\in \\pi^{-1}(U_\\alpha)\\) and \\(\\phi_\\alpha(p) = (m,h)\\), then \\(pg = \\phi_\\alpha^{-1}(m,hg)\\).↩︎ This is well-defined because under a local trivialization \\(\\phi_{\\alpha}\\), letting \\(\\xi_\\alpha(\\pi(p)) = g\\), we have that \\((p,n) \\mapsto (\\pi(p), gn)\\) and \\((ph, h^{-1}n) \\mapsto (\\pi(ph), (gh)h^{-1}n) = (\\pi(p), gn)\\). References: Discussion of local trivialization on associated bundles↩︎ TODO: show equivalence↩︎ The idea here is that a section (smoothly) picks out a particular element of each fibre over the base manifold. For instance, a vector field in \\(\\mathbb{R}^3\\) is an example of a section of the trivial bundle \\(\\mathbb{R}^6 \\to \\mathbb{R}^3\\).↩︎ “Flow” is sometimes used to refer specifically to the action of a one-parameter group of transformations on its manifold: we adopt the term more generally for its brevity and convenience.↩︎ \\[\\begin{align*} (\\psi_* X)(f)(m) &amp;= X(f \\circ \\psi)(\\psi^{-1}(m)) \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{t \\to 0}\\frac{(f \\circ \\psi \\circ \\phi_t)(\\psi^{-1}(m)) - (f \\circ \\psi)(\\psi^{-1}(m))}{t} \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{t \\to 0}\\frac{(f \\circ \\psi \\circ \\phi_t \\circ \\psi^{-1})(m) - (f \\circ \\psi \\circ \\psi^{-1})(m)}{t} \\\\ &amp;= \\lim_{t \\to 0}\\frac{(f \\circ [\\psi \\circ \\phi_t \\circ \\psi^{-1}])(m) - f(m)}{t} \\end{align*}\\]↩︎ We want to take derivatives of tensor fields, but we cannot compare tensors defined on distinct tangent spaces (i.e., in a limit) which certainly cannot be identified (i.e., \\(T_m M\\) and \\(T_{m&#39;} M\\) for \\(m \\neq m&#39;\\)). This is a recurring theme in differential topology/geometry, and one with many different solutions. This is the first solution we encounter: the specification of a vector field provides sufficient directional and ``connective’’ information (via the pushforward) to enable this kind of comparison, and thus, a derivative operator. Note that, in particular, because our definition utilizes a limit, the Lie derivative evaluated at a point \\(m\\) depends upon the local behavior of \\(X,T\\), or the behavior in a neighborhood around \\(m\\) (i.e., not merely at the point \\(m\\)). This manifests itself algebraically in the fact that the Lie derivative is not \\(C^\\infty(M)\\)-linear↩︎ "],["lie-theory.html", "Chapter 3 Lie Theory 3.1 Lie Algebras 3.2 Exponential Map 3.3 Adjoint Representation", " Chapter 3 Lie Theory 3.1 Lie Algebras Let \\(G\\) be a Lie group.

Given a basis \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) of \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\), we have that \\([X_i, X_j] = c_{ij}^h X_h\\) and we say the \\(c_{ij}^h\\) are the structure constants associated with the basis.

For \\(X \\in \\mathfrak{g}\\), let \\(\\phi_{X,t} : G \\to G\\) be the associated flow, and let \\(g_X(t) = \\phi_{X,t}(e) \\in G\\); then \\(g_X\\) is a one parameter subgroup on \\(G\\) (i.e., \\(g_X(t)g_X(s) = g_S(t+s)\\)).

We let \\(C^\\infty (M)^{\\mathbb{C}}\\) denote the complexification of \\(C^\\infty(M)\\): the complexification \\(T_p M^{\\mathbb{C}}\\) is a space of complex dimension \\(2n\\) acts on \\(C^\\infty(M)^{\\mathbb{C}}\\) through linear extension. \\(T_p^* M\\) complexifies in the same way, thereby enabling the complexification of all tensor bundles and their sections (also denoted with superscript \\(\\mathbb{C}\\)). If \\((U,\\phi)\\) is a chart on \\(M\\) with \\(\\phi\\) acting by \\(m \\mapsto (x^1(m) + iy^1(m), \\dots, x^n(m) + iy^n(m))\\), \\(T_m M\\) and \\(T_m^* M\\) are spanned by the dual bases \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^j}\\) and \\(dx^i, dy^j\\); we define new dual bases \\[\\begin{equation} \\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^i} &amp;= \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} - i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i}, \\quad \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\overline{z}^i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} + i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i} \\\\ dz^i &amp;= dx^i + idy^i, \\quad d\\overline{z}^i = dx^i - idy^i \\end{aligned} \\end{equation}\\] Multiplying a vector in \\(T_p M^{\\mathbb{C}}\\) by \\(i\\) amounts to the substitutions \\(\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\to \\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i}\\) and \\(\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial y^i} \\to -\\tfrac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\): this map defines a basis-independent \\((1,1)\\) tensor \\(J_m\\) on \\(T_m M\\) which squares to \\(-1\\) and globally forms a section \\(J \\in \\mathcal{T}^1_1(M)\\) known as the almost complex structure on \\(M\\). This extends linearly to \\(J \\in \\mathcal{T}^1_1(M)^{\\mathbb{C}}\\): in particular, \\(J\\) is diagonal in the \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^i}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\overline{z}^i}\\) basis with eigenvalue \\(i\\) for the former and \\(-i\\) for the latter. In particular, we have projection operators \\(\\mathcal{P}^\\pm\\) onto the \\(\\pm i\\) eigenspaces of \\(J\\) in \\(\\Gamma(M)^{\\mathbb{C}}\\): elements of the image of \\(\\mathcal{P}^+\\) and \\(\\mathcal{P}^-\\) are holomorphic vectors and antiholomorphic vectors, respectively, with analogous terminology for vector fields. Similarly, elements of \\(\\Omega^k(M)^{\\mathbb{C}}\\) which decompose into tensor products of \\(r\\) terms in \\(\\{dz^i\\}\\) and \\(s\\) terms in \\(\\{d\\overline{z}^i\\}\\) are said to have bidegree \\((r,s\\), the set of which is denoted \\(\\Omega^{r,s}(M)\\). It follows that \\(\\Omega^k(M)^{\\mathbb{C}} = \\oplus_{r+s=k} \\Omega^{r,s}(M)\\). Moreover, linearly extending the exterior derivative gives a map \\(\\Omega^{r,s}(M) \\to \\Omega^{r+1,s}(M) + \\Omega^{r,s+1}(M)\\), enabling the definition of the Dolbeault operators \\(\\partial, \\overline{\\partial}\\) which are the \\(\\Omega^{r+1,s}(M)\\) and \\(\\Omega^{r,s+1}(M)\\) parts of \\(d\\), respectively (i.e., \\(d = \\partial + \\overline{\\partial}\\). It follows that \\(\\partial^2 = \\partial\\overline{\\partial} + \\overline{\\partial\\partial} = \\overline{\\partial}^2 = 0\\). Elements of the kernel of \\(\\overline{\\partial}\\) in \\(\\Omega^{k,0}(M)\\) are called holomorphic \\(k\\)-forms; a \\(k\\)-form is holomorphic if and only if the \\(C^\\infty(M)^{\\mathbb{C}}\\) coefficients of the decomposition into the \\(dz^i\\) basis are each holomorphic functions. 5.2 Hermitian and Kahler Geometry Let \\(M\\) also be a Riemannian \\(2n\\)-dimensional manifold with metric \\(g\\), which can be extended linearly to act on \\(\\Gamma(M)^{\\mathbb{C}}\\). Moreover, let \\(M\\) have a metric \\(g\\) that is invariant under precomposition of both arguments with \\(J\\): we say \\(M\\) is a Hermitian manifold and \\(g\\) a Hermitian metric. We use normal and overlined greek indices to denote the evaluation of the metric’s arguments on \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z^i}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\overline{z}^i}\\) terms, respectively: in the Hermitian case, only mixed terms \\(g_{\\mu\\overline{\\nu}}\\) are non-zero. Define the K”ahler form \\(\\Omega \\in \\Omega^2(M)\\) by \\((X, Y) \\mapsto g(J(X), Y)\\); this is also invariant under precomposition by \\(J\\), and extends linearly to an element of \\(\\Omega^{1,1}(M)\\). In particular, \\(\\Omega = ig_{\\mu\\overline{\\nu}} dz^\\mu \\wedge d\\overline{z}^\\nu\\). A Hermitian connection is a connection \\(\\nabla\\) on \\(TM^{\\mathbb{C}}\\) such that, in the \\(z,\\overline{z}\\) basis, we have m\\(\\nabla_\\mu g = 0 = \\nabla_{\\overline{\\mu}} g\\) (metric compatibility) and the connection coefficients vanish when regular and overlined indices are mixed. Curvature and torsion tensors are formed as usual. Moreover, we have the Ricci form \\(\\mathcal{R} = i \\partial \\overline{\\partial} \\log(\\det(g_{\\mu\\overline{\\nu}}))\\). The hermitian covariant derivative of the almost complex structure vanishes. A K”ahler manifold is a Hermitian manifold with closed K\"ahler form, in which case the metric is called a K”ahler metric. This only happens if the Levi-Civita covariant derivative of the almost complex structure vanishes: or, in other words, the Hermitian and Levi-Civita connections are compatible. Indeed, the Ricci form of a K\"ahler metric coincides with the Ricci curvature of the Levi-Civita connection (additionally, the Hermitian connection is torsion-free). 5.3 Dolbeault Cohomology and Hodge Theory Replacing \\(d\\) in de Rham cohomology with \\(\\overline{\\partial}\\) yields Dolbeault cohomology with \\((r,s)\\)-cocycles, \\((r,s)\\)-coboundaries, and \\((r,s)\\)th cohomology groups being defined as expected. Recalling the Hodge star \\(\\ast\\), we have an inner product on \\(\\Omega^{r,s}(M)\\) by \\[\\begin{equation} (\\alpha, \\beta) = \\int_M \\alpha \\wedge \\overline{\\ast} \\beta \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\overline{\\ast} \\beta\\) is defined to be \\(\\overline{\\ast\\beta} = \\ast \\overline{\\beta}\\). From here we define \\(\\partial^\\dagger, \\overline{\\partial}^{\\dagger}\\) to be the adjoints of the Dolbeault operators \\(\\partial, \\overline{\\partial}\\), respectively. They decrement the degree of the forms they act on, square to zero, and obey the following formulas. \\[\\begin{equation} \\partial^\\dagger = - \\ast \\overline{\\partial} \\ast, \\;\\; \\overline{\\partial}^\\dagger = - \\ast \\partial \\ast \\end{equation}\\] We have Laplacians as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta = \\{d, d^\\dagger\\}, \\Delta_\\partial = \\{\\partial, \\partial^\\dagger\\}, \\Delta_{\\overline{\\partial}} = \\{\\overline{\\partial}, \\overline{\\partial}^\\dagger\\}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\{ \\, \\}\\) here is the anticommutator. A form is harmonic with respect to \\(d, \\partial, \\overline{\\partial}\\) if it lies in the kernel of \\(\\Delta, \\Delta_\\partial, \\Delta_{\\overline{\\partial}}\\), respectively. Hodge’s exhibits shows that \\[\\begin{equation} \\Omega^{r,s}(M) = \\overline{\\partial} \\Omega^{r,s-1}(M) + \\overline{\\partial}^\\dagger \\Omega^{r,s+1}(M) + \\text{Harm}_{\\overline{\\partial}}^{r,s}(M) \\end{equation}\\] with this sum being orthogonal with respect to the aforementioned inner product and with \\(\\text{Harm}_{\\overline{\\partial}}^{r,s}(M)\\) the set of \\(\\overline{\\partial}\\)-harmonic \\((r,s)\\) forms on \\(M\\). Note that Dolbeault cohomology classes contain a unique \\(\\overline{\\partial}\\)-harmonic form. In the special case that \\(M\\) is K\"ahler, \\(\\Delta = 2\\Delta_\\partial = 2\\Delta_{\\overline{\\partial}}\\). "],["characteristic-classes.html", "Chapter 6 Characteristic Classes 6.1 Chern-Weil Theory", " Chapter 6 Characteristic Classes 6.1 Chern-Weil Theory Consider \\(S_k(\\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C}))\\) and \\(S(\\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C})) = \\oplus_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} S_k(\\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C}))\\) (formal sums of tensors): in particular, we can define a product \\(S_p(\\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C})) \\times S_q(\\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C})) \\to S_{p+q}(\\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C}))\\) by symmetrizing the tensor product of elements in these respective algebras. Let \\(\\rho\\) be an \\(n\\)-dimensional representation of a group \\(G\\): then \\(\\rho(G) \\subset \\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C})\\). Let \\(\\overline{Q} \\in S_k(\\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C}))\\) be unchanged under precomposition by the \\(n\\)-fold product of the map \\(\\rho(g) : \\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C}) \\to \\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C})\\) for each \\(g \\in G\\). We say \\(\\overline{Q}\\) is invariant, and the space of invariant \\((0,r)\\) tensors is denoted \\(I_r(G,\\rho)\\), and \\(I(G,\\rho)\\) is defined analogously. \\(\\overline{Q}\\) induces a map \\(Q : \\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C}) \\to \\mathbb{C}\\) by precomposing with the appropriate diagonal map: we say \\(P\\) is an invariant polynomial. Conversely, invariant polynomials \\(Q&#39;\\) induce invariant tensors by taking the mapping from \\(A_1 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes A_k\\) to the coefficient of \\(t^1 \\dots t^k\\) in the expansion of \\(Q&#39;(A_it^i)\\) (where the \\(t^i\\) are merely variables). Let \\(P \\to M\\) be a principal \\(G\\)-bundle. \\(\\overline{Q} \\in I_k(G, \\text{Ad})\\) induces a map \\(\\otimes_{i=1}^k \\Omega^k(M,\\mathfrak{g}) \\to \\Omega^k(M)\\) by \\((A_1 \\otimes \\eta_1) \\otimes \\dots \\otimes (A_k \\otimes \\eta_k) \\mapsto \\eta_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge \\eta_k \\, Q(A_1, \\dots, A_k)\\) for \\(A_i \\in \\rho(\\text{Ad}) = \\mathfrak{g} \\subset \\mathbb{M}_n(\\mathbb{C})\\) and \\(\\eta_i \\in \\Omega^k(M)\\). Now let \\(\\overline{Q}\\) be invariant: an analogous action for the invariant polynomial \\(Q\\) is induced. Consider the action of \\(Q\\) on a curvature \\(\\Omega\\) on \\(P\\): the Chern-Weil theorem states that the resulting differential form is closed and that its (de Rham) cohomology class is independent of the particular curvature. This curvature class \\(\\chi_P(\\Omega)\\) is the characteristic class of \\(P\\) given by \\(Q\\). Moreover, \\(\\chi_P(\\Omega) \\in \\Omega^k(P)\\) descends uniquely to an element of \\(\\Omega^k(M)\\), the map \\(\\chi_P : I(G,\\rho) \\to H_{\\text{dR}}^*(M)\\) is a morphism of algebras and is natural in the sense that \\(\\chi_{f^*P} = f^*\\chi_P\\).

Affine n-space \\(\\mathbb{A}^n\\) is \\(\\mathbb{C}^n\\) endowed with the Zariski topoplogy wherein open sets are complements of varieties. We use the notation \\(\\mathbb{V}(F_i)\\) to denote the variety defined by the zero locus of the polynomials \\(F_i : \\mathbb{A}^n \\to \\mathbb{C}\\). Morphisms of varieties are restrictions of polynomial maps between affine spaces, and are continuous in the Zariski topology. An irreducible variety is a variety which cannot be expressed non-trivially as the union of two varieties: this enables the notion of the dimension of a variety, namely the longest chain of proper inclusions of its subvarieties (the number of inclusions, not the number of sets). 8.2 Commutative Ring Theory Interlude For our purposes, a commutative ring, or just a ring, is a set endowed with the structure of an Abelian group (with operation known as “addition”) and a monoid (with operation known as “multiplication”) such that the latter operation distributes over the former. Ring homomorphisms preserve both structures and the identity element. An ideal is a subset of a ring which is closed under addition and invariant under multiplication. The ideal generated by some elements is the intersection of all ideals containing those elements. The radical \\(\\sqrt{I}\\) of an ideal \\(I\\) is the set of elements which possess a power belonging to the ideal. An ideal is maximal if the only ideal properly containing it is the whole ring, prime if a product only belongs to it when both elements of the product belong to it, radical if it coincides with its radical, and reduced if it contains no nilpotent elements. Rings can be quotiented by ideals, and the canonical surjection maps ideals containing the quotienting ideal to ideals in the quotient (preserving maximality, primeness and radicalness). A quotient is a field (multiplication has inverses) if and only if the ideal is maximal and a domain (there exist no zero-divisors, or non-zero elements mapping other non-zero elements to zero via multiplication) if and only if the ideal is prime. In particular, maximal ideals are prime. Moreover, prime ideals are radical and quotients are reduced if and only if the ideal is radical. A \\(\\mathbb{C}\\)-algebra is a ring containing \\(\\mathbb{C}\\), and suitable notions of homomorphism, etc. follow naturally. A Noetherian ring is a finitely generated ring, and Hilbert’s basis theorem states that the rings of polynomials \\(\\mathbb{C}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]\\) are Noetherian. 8.3 Algebra-Geometry Correspondence Let \\(\\mathbb{I}(V)\\) denote the ideal of polynomials vanishing on the variety \\(V\\). Immediately, we see that \\(\\mathbb{V}(\\mathbb{I}(V)) = V\\), so \\(\\mathbb{V}\\) is a left inverse \\(\\mathbb{I}\\) to. Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz reveals that \\(\\mathbb{V}\\) is also a partial right inverse: in particular, let \\(I\\) by a polynomial ideal, then \\(\\mathbb{I}(\\mathbb{V}(I)) = \\sqrt{I}\\). In particular, \\(\\mathbb{V}\\) is a right inverse on radical ideals; said differently, the Nullstellensatz induces a bijection between varieties and radical ideals in \\(\\mathbb{C}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]\\)17. This has many corollaries. For instance, varieties are finite-dimensional; varieties are the zero locus of finitely many polynomials (in particular, the intersection of finitely many hypersurfaces); \\(\\mathbb{I}(V)\\) is radical; and prime ideals are in bijection with irreducible varieties. Consider the coordinate ring \\(\\mathbb{C}[V]\\) of polynomials on \\(V\\). This is \\(\\mathbb{C}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]/\\mathbb{I}(V)\\), hence it is a reduced, finitely generated \\(\\mathbb{C}\\)-algebra. Variety morphisms induce (direction-reversing) morphisms between coordinate rings. The connection between varieties and coordinate rings is a bijection: namely, there is an equivalence (up to arrow-reversing) between the category of varieties and the category of finitely generated reduced \\(\\mathbb{C}\\)-algebras. Alternatively, we can interpret this by defining an equivalence relationship on the ideals of \\(\\mathbb{C}[x_1, \\dots, x_n]\\) by defining similarity between ideals sharing a radical and observing that the cosets of the quotient given by this equivalence are placed in bijection with varieties. This is equivalent to the given interpretation, which merely chooses that radical itself to be a candidate for the coset.↩︎ "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["tensors.html", "A Tensors A.1 Construction A.2 Notation A.3 Change of Basis A.4 Tensor Algebra", " A Tensors A.1 Construction Let \\(V,W\\) be \\(n\\)-dimensional vector spaces over \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) and consider the free vector space \\(F(V \\times W)\\). We define \\(R(V \\times W)\\) as follows. \\[\\begin{align*} R(V \\times W) &amp;= \\Big\\langle (av,bw) - ab(v,w), (v + w, v&#39; + w&#39;) - (v,v&#39;) - (v,w&#39;) \\\\ &amp;\\qquad - (w,v&#39;) - (w,w&#39;) \\; \\Big| \\; a,b \\in \\mathbb{R}; v,v&#39; \\in V; w,w&#39; \\in W \\Big\\rangle \\subset F(V \\times W) \\end{align*}\\] We define the tensor product of \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) by \\(V \\otimes W = F(V \\times W)/R(V \\times W)\\) and denote elements by \\(v \\otimes w\\) (i.e., \\((v,w)\\) belongs to the coset \\(v \\otimes w\\)). Let \\(T^k_\\ell(V) = (\\bigotimes_{i=1}^k V) \\otimes (\\bigotimes_{j=1}^\\ell V^*)\\), the space of \\((k, \\ell)\\) tensors on \\(V\\). This space has dimension \\(n^{k + \\ell}\\), and we can identify \\(T_k^\\ell(V)\\) with \\(T_\\ell^k(V)^*\\)’18. Moreover, observe that elements of \\(T^k_\\ell(V)\\) can be understood as a linear map \\(T^{k-r}_{\\ell-s}(V) \\to T_r^s(V)\\) through partial evaluation: indeed, \\(T_k^\\ell(V)\\) is naturally isomorphic to the hom set \\(Hom(T^{k-r}_{\\ell-s}(V), T^r_s(V))\\). This also entails the natural conclusion \\(T_0^0(V) = \\mathbb{R}\\). Equivalently, \\(w \\in T^{k-r}_{\\ell-s}(V)\\) is a linear map \\(T^k_\\ell(V) \\to T^r_s(V)\\)19. Finally, we note in passing that because \\(V^\\ell \\times (V^*)^k \\subset F((V)^\\ell \\times (V^*)^k)\\), we also have a multilinear action of \\(T^k_\\ell(V)\\) on \\(V^\\ell \\times (V^*)^k\\) (indeed, one can define \\(T^r_s(V)\\) as the set of multilinear maps on this space). A.2 Notation Let \\(e_a\\), \\(\\sigma^b\\) constitute dual bases for \\(V, V^*\\): then \\(v \\in T^k_\\ell(V)\\) can be written in components as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} v = \\sum_{\\mu_1 = 1}^n \\dots \\sum_{\\nu_k = 1}^n v^{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_k}_{\\nu_1\\dots \\nu_\\ell} e_{\\mu_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes e_{\\mu_k} \\otimes \\sigma^{\\nu_1} \\otimes \\dots \\otimes \\sigma^{\\nu_\\ell} \\qquad (v^{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_k}_{\\nu_1\\dots \\nu_\\ell} \\in \\mathbb{R}) \\end{equation}\\] For brevity we adopt Einstein summation notation wherein a doubly-appearing index (once a superscript, once a subscript) is always assumed to be summed over, rending each \\(\\Sigma\\) obsolete; we also suppress the \\(\\otimes\\) symbol. Thus, we rewrite \\(v\\) as follows20. \\[\\begin{equation} v = v_{\\nu_1\\dots \\nu_\\ell}^{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_k} e_{\\mu_1} \\dots e_{\\mu_k} \\sigma^{\\nu_1} \\dots \\sigma^{\\nu_\\ell} \\end{equation}\\] Finally, we adopt Penrose’s abstract index notation wherein we append indices to \\(v\\) labelling its arguments (or, by duality, the arguments of other tensors that \\(v\\) can satisfy). Subscripts denote vector arguments, superscripts denote dual vector arguments, and summation over an abstract index is evaluation. This results in \\(v\\) being expressed as follows. \\[\\begin{equation} v = v_{b_1\\dots b_\\ell}^{a_1\\dots a_k} \\end{equation}\\] To avoid confusion, henceforth unsummed roman indices are abstract while unsummed greek indices denote particular components (e.g., of a tensor, given a basis). A.3 Change of Basis Note that \\(T_1^1(V)\\) coincides with the space of endomorphisms on \\(V\\), so the automorphisms are a subset. Suppose then that \\(\\Lambda_a^b \\in T_1^1(V)\\) is a change of basis: i.e., we let \\(e_\\mu \\mapsto e_\\mu^\\prime = \\Lambda(e_\\mu, \\cdot) = \\Lambda_b^a (e_\\mu)^b\\). The dual basis \\(\\sigma^{\\prime\\nu}\\) must satisfy \\(\\delta_\\mu^\\nu = (e^\\prime_\\mu)^a (\\sigma^{\\prime \\nu})_a = \\Lambda_b^a (e_\\mu)^b (\\sigma^{\\prime \\nu})_a = (e_\\mu)^a(\\sigma^{\\nu})_a\\), so we conclude \\(\\sigma^{\\prime\\nu} = \\Lambda^{-1}(\\cdot, \\sigma^\\nu) = (\\Lambda^{-1})_a^b (\\sigma^\\nu)_b\\), where \\(\\Lambda^{-1}\\) is the inverse to \\(\\Lambda\\) (i.e., \\((\\Lambda^{-1})^a_b \\Lambda^b_c = \\delta^a_c\\)). The coefficients of \\(v\\) then transform as follows21. \\[\\begin{equation} v_{\\nu_1\\dots \\nu_\\ell}^{\\prime \\mu_1\\dots \\mu_k} = (\\Lambda^{-1})^{\\mu_1}_{\\kappa_1} \\dots (\\Lambda^{-1})^{\\mu_k}_{\\kappa_k}v_{\\lambda_1\\dots \\lambda_\\ell}^{\\kappa_1 \\dots \\kappa_k} \\Lambda^{\\lambda_1}_{\\nu_1} \\dots \\Lambda^{\\lambda_\\ell}_{\\nu_\\ell} \\end{equation}\\] This exhibits two distinct transformation rules, one for upper indices and one for lower: we say the upper indices transform contravariantly and the lower indices transform covariantly. A third definition of a tensor is an assignment of a multidimensional array of numbers to each pair of bases of \\(V\\) and \\(V^*\\) such that the various assignments are related by the above transformation rule. The tensor \\(v\\) must remain invariant under a change in coordinates, so because \\(v = v_{\\nu_1\\dots \\nu_\\ell}^{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_k} e_{\\mu_1} \\dots e_{\\mu_k} \\sigma^{\\nu_1} \\dots \\sigma^{\\nu_\\ell}\\) we are assured that \\(e_{\\mu_1} \\dots e_{\\mu_k} \\sigma^{\\nu_1} \\dots \\sigma^{\\nu_\\ell}\\) transforms inversely to \\(v_{\\nu_1\\dots \\nu_\\ell}^{\\mu_1\\dots \\mu_k}\\), implying the following transformation law. \\[\\begin{equation} e^\\prime_{\\mu_1} \\dots e^\\prime_{\\mu_k} \\sigma^{\\prime\\nu_1} \\dots \\sigma^{\\prime\\nu_\\ell} = \\Lambda_{\\mu_1}^{\\kappa_1} \\dots \\Lambda_{\\mu_k}^{\\kappa_k} e_{\\kappa_1} \\dots e_{\\kappa_k} \\sigma^{\\lambda_1} \\dots \\sigma^{\\lambda_\\ell} (\\Lambda^{-1})_{\\lambda_1}^{\\nu_1} \\dots (\\Lambda^{-1})_{\\lambda_\\ell}^{\\nu_\\ell} \\end{equation}\\] This (finally) motivates our choice of subscripts for vector bases and superscripts for dual vector bases: we are seeing that components of vectors and dual vector bases transform covariantly, while components of dual vectors and vector bases transform contravariantly (albeit by \\(\\Lambda\\) and \\(\\Lambda^{-1}\\), respectively, in each case). By functional-argumentative duality, any element of \\(T_k^\\ell(V)\\) can yield an element of \\(T_{k-1}^{\\ell-1}(V)\\) by evaluating one vector (dual vector) argument on a dual vector (vector) argument: we refer to this as contraction and denote it by repeating an abstract index appropriately (e.g., the trace of a linear transformation is a contraction of its two arguments). A.4 Tensor Algebra We define the tensor algebra of \\(V\\), \\(T(V) = \\oplus_{k,\\ell = 0}^\\infty T_k^\\ell(V)\\), which is a graded algebra with multiplication operation \\(\\otimes\\). From we can also define the algebra ideal \\(I(V) = \\langle v \\otimes v \\; | \\; v \\in V\\rangle\\) and consider the quotient algebra \\(\\Lambda(V) = T(V) / I(V)\\), denoted the exterior algebra. Defining \\(I_k(V) = I(V) \\cap T_k^0(V)\\), we have the decomposition \\(\\Lambda(V) = \\oplus_{k=0}^\\infty T_k^0(V)/I_k(V) = \\oplus_{k=0}^\\infty \\Lambda_k(V)\\); we refer to elements of \\(\\Lambda_k(V)\\) as \\(k\\)-forms on \\(V\\), and \\(\\dim \\Lambda_k(V) = \\binom{n}{k}\\). Multiplication in \\(\\Lambda(V)\\) is denoted by \\(\\wedge\\) and referred to as the wedge product. The coset in \\(\\Lambda(V)\\) containing \\(v_1 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes v_{m} \\in T(V)\\) is exactly \\(v_1 \\wedge \\dots \\wedge v_{k+\\ell}\\). We can identify \\(\\Lambda_k(V)\\) with the set of alternating \\((k,0)\\) tensors; in abstract index notation, these satisfy \\(v_{a_1\\dots a_i \\dots a_j \\dots a_k} = -v_{a_1\\dots a_j \\dots a_i \\dots a_k}\\). The tensor product coincides with the wedge product for such elements. TODO: (anti)symmetric matrices To see this, let \\(v = v_1 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes v_{k+\\ell} \\in T_k^\\ell(V)\\). \\[\\begin{equation} v \\leftrightarrow (w_1 \\otimes \\dots \\otimes w_{k+\\ell} \\mapsto v_1(w_1) \\cdot \\dotsc \\cdot v_{k+\\ell}(w_{k+\\ell})) \\end{equation}\\] Linearity extends this to arbitrary elements of \\(T_k^\\ell(V)\\).
