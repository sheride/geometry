"],["manifolds.html", "Chapter 2 Manifolds 2.1 Construction 2.2 Smooth Maps 2.3 Tangent Spaces", " Chapter 2 Manifolds 2.1 Construction Let \\(M\\) be a second-countable1, Hausdorff2, locally Euclidean topological space of dimension \\(n\\). We define an equivalence relation on the set of homeomorphisms between open subsets of \\(M\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) given by \\(\\phi \\sim \\psi\\) when \\(\\psi \\circ \\phi^{-1}\\) is smooth. We then choose a \\(\\mathcal{U} = \\{(U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha)\\}\\) (i.e., \\(\\phi_\\alpha : U_\\alpha \\to \\mathbb{R}^n\\)) such that the \\(\\{U_\\alpha\\}\\) cover \\(M\\) and the \\(\\{\\phi_\\alpha\\}\\) are an equivalence class: this is denoted a maximal atlas3. We then say that \\(M\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional smooth manifold4 (or manifold). Let \\((\\phi, U) \\in \\mathcal{U}\\): \\(\\phi\\) is a coordinate chart (or chart) and the components of \\(\\phi\\), \\(x^i\\) (i.e., \\(\\phi_\\alpha(m) = (x^1(m), \\dots, x^n(m))\\)), are coordinates. We say real-valued maps are functions (e.g., the \\(x^i\\) are functions). 2.2 Smooth Maps Given another manifold \\(N\\), we say \\(f : V \\to N\\) is a smooth map (or smooth) for an open set \\(V \\subseteq M\\) when for all \\(m \\in U\\), there exist charts \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) defined around \\(m\\) and \\(f(m)\\) such that \\(\\psi \\circ f \\circ \\phi^{-1}\\) is smooth. Given \\(f : U \\to N\\) for arbitrary \\(U \\subset M\\), we say the same when \\(f\\) is the restriction of a smooth map on some open \\(W \\supseteq V\\). We call smooth maps with smooth inverse diffeomorphisms. We use \\(C^\\infty(M)\\), \\(\\text{Diff}(M,N)\\), and \\(\\text{Diff}(M)\\) to denote the spaces of smooth functions on \\(M\\), diffeomorphisms \\(M \\to N\\), and diffeomorphisms \\(M \\to M\\), respectively. From this point forward, all maps are smooth unless otherwise specified. 2.3 Tangent Spaces Let \\(T_m M\\) denote the vector space of linear derivations on the (vector) space of germs of functions defined around \\(m\\), \\(F_m\\). Equivalently, let \\(T_m M\\) be the quotient ring \\((F_m/F_m^2)^*\\), where \\(*\\) denotes the dual space5. \\(T_m M\\) has dimension \\(n\\), and we call it the tangent space to \\(M\\) at \\(m\\) and elements of \\(T_m M\\) vectors. There is a natural map \\(f \\mapsto f_*\\) from the set of smooth functions \\(M \\to N\\), denoted \\(C^\\infty(M,N)\\), to the set of endomorphisms \\(T_m M \\to T_{f(m)} N\\) given by \\(f_* X(g) \\mapsto X(g \\circ f)\\) (where \\(X \\in T_m M\\) and \\(g \\in C^\\infty(M)\\), the ring of smooth functions on \\(M\\)). W e call \\(f_*\\) the pushfoward of \\(f\\). We define \\(T_m^* M\\) to be the cotangent space to \\(M\\) at \\(m\\), and we have the dual map \\(f \\mapsto f^*\\), the pullback, acting as \\(T_{f(m)}^* N \\to T_m^* M\\) by \\(f^* A(X) = A(f_* X)\\). There is additionally a natural map \\(d : C^\\infty(M) \\to T_m^* M\\) given by \\(f \\mapsto df(m) = v \\mapsto v(f)\\), which we call the differential. Given a chart \\(\\phi\\) around \\(M\\), a basis for \\(T_m M\\) is given by \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\) or \\(\\partial_{i}\\), given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\partial_{i}f = \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ \\phi^{-1})}{\\partial r^i}\\Big|_m \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r^i\\) is the \\(i\\)th Euclidean coordinate. A basis is also given for \\(T^*_m M\\) by the \\(dx^i\\). Finally, we define the tangent bundle \\(TM = \\cup_{m\\in M} T_m M\\) and the cotangent bundle \\(T^*M = \\cup_{m\\in M} T_m^* M\\); both are \\(2n\\)-dimensional smooth manifolds equipped with natural projection maps onto \\(M\\). Arguably, the truly important property here is paracompactness, which is slightly stronger and enables partitions of unity (enabling local-to-global promotions). However, it is a result that Hausdorff, second countable, locally compact space is paracompact (and we get local compactness follows from locally Euclidean). Second countability also contributes to the feasibility of Euclidean embeddings and other nice, preferable behavior. References: Second countability and manifolds↩︎ Hausdorff topological spaces feature points which are sufficiently disjoint: in particular, calculus depends upon limits, and Hausdorff \\(\\implies\\) unique limits as desired (note, though, that the converse isn’t true).↩︎ Definitions vary here (indeed, it is more conventional to merely require “maximal” atlases) but the general motivation is as follows: given a chart \\(\\phi\\) on a manifold \\(M\\), there are likely uncountably many collections of charts covering \\(M\\) containing \\(\\phi\\), but there is a unique (i.e., canonical) choice of equivalence class of charts containing \\(\\phi\\). References: Axiom of choice and maximal atlases↩︎ Our consideration of differential topology/geometry is motivated by physics, which interests itself in the dynamics (or change) of our universe. Calculus, in a word, is the mathematics of change: hence, we are interested in studying the least structured space that permits the calculus. This is not Euclidean space itself but rather a smooth manifold, a space that need only resemble Euclidean space locally.↩︎ TODO: prove equivalence of definitions.↩︎ "],["lie-theory.html", "Chapter 3 Lie Theory 3.1 Lie Groups 3.2 Lie Algebras", " Chapter 3 Lie Theory 3.1 Lie Groups A Lie group \\(G\\) is a smooth manifold with group structure such that the binary operation is smooth.6 Elements \\(g \\in G\\) induce \\(R_g, L_g, A_g \\in \\text{Diff}(G)\\) by \\(R_g : h \\mapsto hg\\), \\(L_g : h \\mapsto gh\\), and \\(A_g = L_g \\circ R_{g^{-1}} : h \\mapsto ghg^{-1}\\). 3.2 Lie Algebras A vector field \\(X\\) on \\(G\\) satisfying \\((L_g)_* X = X \\circ L_g\\) is called left invariant. The Lie algebra to \\(G\\), \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\), is the set of all left-invariant vector fields on \\(G\\); the name is natural as the Lie bracket induces a Lie algebraic structure on this set. Note that \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\) is naturally isomorphic to \\(T_e G\\), where \\(e\\) is the identity element, as \\(Y \\in T_e G\\) induces a vector field \\(X\\) given by \\(X_g = (L_g)_* Y\\); in particular, this means \\(\\dim \\mathfrak{g} = \\dim G\\). Given a basis \\(X_1, \\dots, X_n\\) of \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\), we have that \\([X_i, X_j] = c_{ij}^h X_h\\) and we say the \\(c_{ij}^h\\) are the structure constants associated with the basis. Identifying \\(\\mathfrak{g} \\cong T_e G\\) there is a natural \\(\\mathfrak{g}\\)-valued one-form \\(\\theta\\) on \\(G\\) defined by \\(v \\mapsto (L_{g^{-1}})_*(v)\\) for \\(v \\in T_g G\\). We call this the Maurer-Cartan one-form. Noting that, if \\(G\\) is a matrix Lie group, \\((L_g)_*\\) coincides with the natural matrix multiplication action of the matrix \\(g\\) on \\(TG\\), we have that \\(\\theta(v) = g^{-1}v\\) where the right hand side is matrix multiplication7. A one-parameter subgroup on \\(G\\) is a continuous group homomorphism \\(\\mathbb{R} \\to G\\). For \\(X \\in \\mathfrak{g}\\), let \\(\\phi_{X,t} : G \\to G\\) be the associated flow, and let \\(g_X(t) = \\phi_{X,t}(e) \\in G\\); then \\(g_X\\) is a one parameter subgroup on \\(G\\) (i.e., \\(g_X(t)g_X(s) = g_S(t+s)\\)). Moreover, we have the exponential map \\(\\exp : \\mathfrak{g} \\to G\\) given by \\(X \\mapsto g_X(1)\\). From this it follows that \\(g_X(t) = \\exp(tX)\\); indeed, this is the most general form for a one parameter group. Some authors require the inverse map \\(g \\mapsto g^{-1}\\) to be smooth as well, but this follows from the smoothness of the binary operation.↩︎ If we let \\(G\\) be embedded in a matrix Lie group by a map \\(\\phi\\), then the Maurer-Carten form on \\(\\phi(G)\\) is \\(\\theta = \\phi(g^{-1})\\phi_*\\).↩︎ "],["fibre-bundles.html", "Chapter 4 Fibre Bundles 4.1 Construction 4.2 Principal Bundles 4.3 Associated Bundles 4.4 Sections", " Chapter 4 Fibre Bundles 4.1 Construction Let \\(M, F\\) be manifolds and \\(E\\) be a fibre bundle with base \\(M\\) and fibre \\(F\\), or a manifold endowed with a surjective projection \\(\\pi : E \\to M\\) such that \\(M\\) admits an open covering \\(\\{U_\\alpha\\}\\) for which each \\(U_\\alpha\\) has a diffeomorphism \\(\\phi_\\alpha : \\pi^{-1}(U_\\alpha) \\to U_\\alpha \\times F\\) acting by \\(p \\to (\\pi(p), \\xi_\\alpha(p))\\) for \\(p \\in P\\) and some \\(\\xi_\\alpha : U_\\alpha \\to \\text{Diff}(F)\\). This implies \\(\\pi^{-1}(m)\\) is diffeomorphic to \\(F\\); we say \\(E\\) is locally a product of \\(M\\) and \\(F\\) and that the \\((U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha)\\) is a local trivialization. On \\(U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta\\) we have functions \\(\\phi_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\phi_\\alpha \\circ \\phi_\\beta^{-1} : (U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta) \\times F \\to (U_\\alpha \\cap U_\\beta) \\times F\\) given by \\((m, x) \\mapsto (m, \\xi_{\\alpha\\beta}(m)(x))\\) for some \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta}(m) \\in \\text{Diff}(F)\\) called transition functions. Sometimes we require \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta}(m) \\in G\\), a topological group acting on \\(F\\) on the left by diffeomorphisms (i.e., a subgroup of \\(\\text{Diff}(F)\\)). If a fibre bundle’s local trivializations satisfy this maximally, we say \\(E\\) is a \\(G\\)-bundle, and that \\(G\\) is the structure group. We note that \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\alpha} = 1\\), \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta} = \\xi_{\\beta\\alpha}^{-1}\\), and the cocycle condition \\(\\xi_{\\alpha\\beta} \\circ \\xi_{\\beta\\delta} \\circ \\xi_{\\delta\\alpha} = 1\\) holds on triple overlaps. Fibre bundles are uniquely determined by the base manifold and the transition functions. Given a manifold \\(N\\) and a map \\(g : N \\to M\\), the pullback bundle \\(g^*E\\) is the subset of \\(N \\times E\\) such that \\(g \\circ \\text{proj}_{1} = \\pi \\circ \\text{proj}_{2}\\) with projection \\(\\text{proj}_{1} : g^*E \\to N\\). A vector bundle is a fibre bundle whose fibres are vector spaces and whose local trivializations are fibre-wise linear isomorphisms. 4.2 Principal Bundles Let \\(G\\) be a Lie group and \\(P\\) be a principle \\(G\\)-bundle with base \\(M\\), or a \\(G\\)-bundle over \\(M\\) with fibre \\(G\\) and transition functions given by left multiplication. Because left and right multiplication commute, we have an invariant right action of \\(G\\) on \\(P\\)8. Equivalently, a principle \\(G\\)-bundle \\(P\\) is a fibre bundle with a regular smooth right action by a Lie group \\(G\\) that preserves fibres and the \\(\\xi_\\alpha\\) are \\(G\\)-equivariant. It follows that \\(P/G = M\\)9 and \\(E\\) admits a local trivialization with \\(M \\times G\\). 4.3 Associated Bundles 4.4 Sections 4.4.1 Vector Fields 4.4.2 Tensor Fields 4.4.3 Differential Forms If \\(p \\in \\pi^{-1}(U_\\alpha)\\) and \\(\\phi_\\alpha(p) = (m,h)\\), then \\(pg = \\phi_\\alpha^{-1}(m,hg)\\).↩︎ The second definition admits an exchange between fibre-preservation and \\(P/G = M\\)↩︎ "],["applications.html", "Chapter 5 Applications 5.1 Example one 5.2 Example two", " Chapter 5 Applications Some significant applications are demonstrated in this chapter. 5.1 Example one 5.2 Example two "],["complex-manifolds.html", "Chapter 6 Complex Manifolds", " Chapter 6 Complex Manifolds We have finished a nice book.
