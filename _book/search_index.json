You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["manifolds.html", "Chapter 2 Manifolds 2.1 Introduction 2.2 Smooth Maps 2.3 Tangent Spaces", " Chapter 2 Manifolds 2.1 Introduction Let \\(M\\) be a second-countable1, Hausdorff2, locally Euclidean topological space of dimension \\(n\\). We define an equivalence relation on the set of homeomorphisms between open subsets of \\(M\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\) given by \\(\\phi \\sim \\psi\\) when \\(\\psi \\circ \\phi^{-1}\\) is smooth. We then choose a \\(\\mathcal{U} = \\{(U_\\alpha, \\phi_\\alpha)\\}\\) (i.e., \\(\\phi_\\alpha : U_\\alpha \\to \\mathbb{R}^n\\)) such that the \\(\\{U_\\alpha\\}\\) cover \\(M\\) and the \\(\\{\\phi_\\alpha\\}\\) are an equivalence class: this is denoted a maximal atlas3. We then say that \\(M\\) is an \\(n\\)-dimensional smooth manifold4 (or manifold). Let \\((\\phi, U) \\in \\mathcal{U}\\): \\(\\phi\\) is a coordinate chart (or chart) and the components of \\(\\phi\\), \\(x^i\\) (i.e., \\(\\phi_\\alpha(m) = (x^1(m), \\dots, x^n(m))\\)), are coordinates. We say real-valued maps are functions (e.g., the \\(x^i\\) are functions). 2.2 Smooth Maps Given another manifold \\(N\\), we say \\(f : V \\to N\\) is a smooth map (or smooth) for an open set \\(V \\subseteq M\\) when for all \\(m \\in U\\), there exist charts \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\psi\\) defined around \\(m\\) and \\(f(m)\\) such that \\(\\psi \\circ f \\circ \\phi^{-1}\\) is smooth. For arbitrary \\(U\\), we say the same when there exists \\(F : W \\to N\\) for an open set \\(V \\subset W \\subseteq M\\) such that \\(F_{|V} = f\\) and \\(F\\) is smooth. We call smooth maps with smooth inverse diffeomorphisms. We use \\(C^\\infty(M)\\), \\(\\text{Diff}(M,N)\\), and \\(\\text{Diff}(M)\\) to denote the spaces of smooth functions on \\(M\\), diffeomorphisms \\(M \\to N\\), and diffeomorphisms \\(M \\to M\\), respectively. From this point forward, all maps are smooth unless otherwise specified. 2.3 Tangent Spaces Let \\(T_m M\\) denote the vector space of linear derivations on the (vector) space of germs of functions defined around \\(m\\), \\(F_m\\). Alternatively, let \\(T_m M\\) be the quotient ring \\((F_m/F_m^2)^*\\), where \\(*\\) denotes the dual space. \\(T_m M\\) has dimension \\(n\\), and we call it the tangent space to \\(M\\) at \\(m\\) and elements of \\(T_m M\\) vectors. There is a natural map \\(f \\mapsto f_*\\) from the set of smooth functions \\(M \\to N\\), denoted \\(C^\\infty(M,N)\\), to the set of endomorphisms \\(T_m M \\to T_{f(m)} N\\) given by \\(f_* X(g) \\mapsto X(g \\circ f)\\) (where \\(X \\in T_m M\\) and \\(g \\in C^\\infty(M)\\), the ring of smooth functions on \\(M\\)). We call \\(f_*\\) the pushfoward of \\(f\\). We define \\(T_m^* M\\) to be the cotangent space to \\(M\\) at \\(m\\); there is a natural map \\(d : C^\\infty(M) \\to T_m^* M\\) given by \\(f \\mapsto df(m) = v \\mapsto v(f)\\), which we call the differential. We also have the dual map \\(f \\mapsto f^*\\), the pullback, acting as \\(T_{f(m)}^* N \\to T_m^* M\\) by \\(f^* A(X) = A(f_* X)\\). Given a chart \\(\\phi\\) around \\(M\\), a basis for \\(T_m M\\) is given by \\(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\) or \\(\\partial_{i}\\), given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\partial_{i}f = \\frac{\\partial (f \\circ \\phi^{-1})}{\\partial r^i}\\Big|_m \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r^i\\) is the \\(i\\)th Euclidean coordinate. A basis is also given for \\(T^*_m M\\) by the \\(dx^i\\). Finally, we define the tangent bundle \\(TM = \\cup_{m\\in M} T_m M\\) and the cotangent bundle \\(T^*M = \\cup_{m\\in M} T_m^* M\\); both are \\(2n\\)-dimensional smooth manifolds equipped with natural projection maps onto \\(M\\). Arguably, the truly important property here is paracompactness, which is slightly stronger and enables partitions of unity (enabling local-to-global promotions). However, it is a result that Hausdorff, second countable, locally compact space is paracompact (and we get local compactness follows from locally Euclidean). Second countability also contributes to the feasibility of Euclidean embeddings and other nice, preferable behavior. References: Second countability and manifolds↩︎ Hausdorff topological spaces feature points which are sufficiently disjoint: in particular, calculus depends upon limits, and Hausdorff \\(\\implies\\) unique limits as desired (note, though, that the converse isn’t true).↩︎ Definitions vary here (indeed, it is more conventional to merely require “maximal” atlases) but the general motivation is as follows: given a chart \\(\\phi\\) on a manifold \\(M\\), there are likely uncountably many collections of charts covering \\(M\\) containing \\(\\phi\\), but there is a unique (i.e., canonical) choice of equivalence class of charts containing \\(\\phi\\). References: Axiom of choice and maximal atlases↩︎ Our consideration of differential topology/geometry is motivated by physics, which interests itself in the dynamics (or change) of our universe. Calculus, in a word, is the mathematics of change: hence, we are interested in studying the least structured space that permits the calculus. This is not Euclidean space itself but rather a smooth manifold, a space that need only resemble Euclidean space locally.↩︎ "],["fibre-bundles.html", "Chapter 3 Fibre Bundles", " Chapter 3 Fibre Bundles "],["lie-theory.html", "Chapter 4 Lie Theory", " Chapter 4 Lie Theory Example (short) footnote5.
