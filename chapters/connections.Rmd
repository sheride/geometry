# Connections

To each $A \in \mathfrak{g}$ we can naturally associate a `r term("fundamental vector field")` $A^*$ on $P$ given by $(A^\#)(p) = (\sigma_p)_*(A)$, where $\sigma_p : G \to P$ is the map $g \mapsto pg$. Equivalently, $(A^\#)(p)$ is the tangent vector to the curve $(\sigma_p \circ \exp)(At)$ at $t = 0$. Define $V_p = T_p \, \pi^{-1}(p) = \ker(\pi_*) \cap T_p P$, the `r term("vertical subspace")` of $T_p P$; $A \mapsto (A^*)_p$ is an isomorphism $\mathfrak{g} \mapsto V_p$. Moreover, $A \mapsto A^\#$ is equivariant with respect to the adjoint and principal actions of $G$ and preserves the respective Lie brackets. The `r term("vertical bundle")` $VP = TP$ is the vector subbundle of these vertical subspaces. 

To a principal bundle we can associate its `r term("Atiyah sequence")`.

where $\iota$ is the natural inclusion and $\overline{\pi}$ is the map $X \mapsto (\pi_{TP}(X), (\pi_P)_*(X))$. A `r term("connection")` on $P$ is a choice of equivariant split for this sequence (direct sum, left, and right splits are equivalent). Explicitly, the $G$ actions are the diagonal action (identifying $VP \cong P \times \mathfrak{g}$), the canonical action, and the induced action from $P \times TM$ leaving $TM$ invariant, respectively.  

In particular, a direct sum split $\varphi$ is frequently identified with the vector subbundle $HP = \varphi^{-1}(0 \oplus \pi^* TM)$, which is complementary to $VP$ and invariant under $(R_g)_*$ for $g \in G$ and referred to as an `r term("Ehresmann connection")`. Left splits can be understood as $G$-equivariant $\mathfrak{g}$-valued one-forms on $P$, commonly referred to as `r term("connection one-forms")`. Right splits are interpreted as maps sending a vector in $T_m M$ to one in any $T_p P$ for $p \in \pi^{-1}(m)$ and are known as `r term("horizontal lifts")`.
